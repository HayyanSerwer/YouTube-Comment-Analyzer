## App Summary

YouTube's API is used to fetch YouTube comments using links.
ChatGPT's API evaluates the comments, providing information on what users feel about the video. (Similar to YouTube's AI Sumamry)

I'd like to add a content recommendation system based on user feedback using something like the content filtering algorithm down the line (Once the frontend is mostly complete)
