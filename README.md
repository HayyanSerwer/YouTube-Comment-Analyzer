## Work In Progress


## App Summary

YouTube's API is used to fetch YouTube comments using links.
Python's NLTK to perform sentiment analysis on the extracted comments, providing information on what users feel about the video. Visualization / data processing through Pandas And Matplotlib.

Down the line, I'd like to add a content recommendation system based on user feedback using something like the content filtering algorithm down the line (Once the frontend is mostly complete)
